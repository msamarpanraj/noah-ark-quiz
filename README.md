## Project Background:

The Bible Quiz Project is an interactive web application designed to educate and engage users with questions related to the Bible. This project was created as a part of a Code Instituteâ€™s Diploma in Web Application Development Course to showcase proficiency in web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Throughout the development of this game I followed the principles of User Experience (UX), including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. At all times I wanted to make sure that the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the goals and needs of the user and client.

### Key Factors

The Bible Quiz App is driven by several key factors:

- **Educational Significance:** The project aims to serve as an educational resource, making it possible for users to engage with the story of Noah's Ark in a meaningful and educational manner. It supports the pursuit of biblical literacy and a deeper understanding of this iconic narrative.

- **Interactive Learning:** By providing a quiz format, the project encourages interactive learning. Users can actively participate in the learning process, which can be more engaging and effective compared to passive learning methods.

- **Skill Showcase:** This project serves as a platform to demonstrate web development skills, including proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It represents the ability to design and create interactive web applications, an essential skill in today's digital landscape.

- **User Engagement:** User engagement is a central factor. The incorporation of limited attempts, immediate feedback, a time limit for questions, and progress tracking is aimed at motivating users to actively participate and challenge their biblical knowledge.

- **Measurement and Reporting:** The application provides a means for users to measure their knowledge and progress. Users can track the number of questions answered, the number of correct answers, their overall score, and the percentage of questions they answered correctly.

- **User-Friendly Design:** The user experience and interface design are critical factors. The project prioritizes a user-friendly and intuitive design to ensure accessibility and ease of use for a broad user base, including those with varying levels of technological familiarity.

The Bible Quiz App is a project that blends educational significance with technical skill demonstration while ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience for participants.

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to provide a user-friendly and engaging platform for individuals interested in testing their knowledge of the Bible, specifically focusing on the story of Noah's Ark. The project aims to deliver an interactive learning experience by incorporating various features, such as user registration, limited attempts, score tracking, and time-limited questions. It serves as an educational tool for individuals looking to enhance their understanding of this significant biblical narrative.
