# Project Background:

The Bible Quiz Project is an interactive web application designed to educate and engage users with questions related to the Bible. This project was created as a part of a Code Institute’s Diploma in Web Application Development Course to showcase proficiency in web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Throughout the development of this quiz I followed the principles of User Experience (UX), including the 5 planes of Strategy, Scope, Structure, Skeleton & Surface. At all times I wanted to make sure that the website was easy to use, responsive, accessible and intuitive as well as meeting the goals and needs of the user and client.

### Key Factors

The Bible Quiz App is driven by several key factors:

- **Educational Significance:** The project aims to serve as an educational resource, making it possible for users to engage with the story of Noah's Ark in a meaningful and educational manner. It supports the pursuit of biblical literacy and a deeper understanding of this iconic narrative.

- **Interactive Learning:** By providing a quiz format, the project encourages interactive learning. Users can actively participate in the learning process, which can be more engaging and effective compared to passive learning methods.

- **Skill Showcase:** This project serves as a platform to demonstrate web development skills, including proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It represents the ability to design and create interactive web applications, an essential skill in today's digital landscape.

- **User Engagement:** User engagement is a central factor. The incorporation of limited attempts, immediate feedback, a time limit for questions, and question tracking is aimed at motivating users to actively participate and challenge their biblical knowledge.

- **Measurement and Reporting:** The application provides a means for users to measure their knowledge and progress. Users can track the number of questions attempted, the number of correct answers and their overall score.

- **User-Friendly Design:** The user experience and interface design are critical factors. The project prioritizes a user-friendly and intuitive design to ensure accessibility and ease of use for a broad user base, including those with varying levels of technological familiarity.

The Bible Quiz App is a project that blends educational significance with technical skill demonstration while ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience for participants.

# Project Goals

## User Goals

The Bible Quiz App is designed with a focus on fulfilling the following user goals:

1. Users aim to engage with the Bible and the story of Noah's Ark in an educational and interactive manner. The primary goal is to enhance their knowledge of this biblical narrative.

2. Participants seek opportunities to actively engage with the content, answering questions and receiving immediate feedback whether the option they choose is right or wrong, which is often more engaging and effective compared to passive learning.

3. Users wish to gauge and assess their knowledge of the Bible. They aim to test their understanding of the story of Noah's Ark, gain insights into their proficiency, and identify areas for improvement.

4. User goals also include a user-friendly and intuitive experience. The project aims to provide an accessible and enjoyable platform for individuals with varying levels of technological familiarity.

5. Users aspire to engage in an interactive challenge. The incorporation of limited attempts, a time limit for questions, and immediate feedback adds an element of challenge and excitement to the learning experience.

By aligning with these user goals, the Noah's Ark Bible Quiz App aims to fulfill the educational and engagement needs of its participants while providing an enjoyable and user-friendly learning platform.

## Design

### Structure

The website consists of 2 pages (index.html and 404.html) which both have a consistent structure and design. The background image was taken from pixabay.com and the image is closely related to the Noah's Ark as you can see the Ark during floods. The main goal is to test a user's knowledge on Noah's Ark.

## Design Choices

### Fonts

I have chosen Poppins font from google fonts for the website as I feel this is a clean looking font.

### Colours

The colour scheme for the website came from the background image, which was sourced from pixabay. Additional colors were generated to compliment the website design and highlight the buttons as they are very important on the site from coolors.co

![Coolors Palette](docs/readme-images/colors.png)

### Imagery

The background image on index.html and 404.html is a picture of the Noah's Ark as this is the theme of the quiz, it features the Ark floating in the ocean. This was sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/noahs-ark-ship-animals-art-flood-3008693/)

# Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the CodeAnywhere code editor and which was connected to github. A new workspace is imported to codeanywhere from github repositories and the following is the repository which this project was associated.
<https://github.com/msamarpanraj/noah-ark-quiz>

During development, the following Git commands were utilized to manage code updates:

`git add <file>` - This command added specific file(s) to the staging area for the next commit.
`git commit -m “commit message”` - It was used to commit changes to the local repository, preparing them for the final step.
`git push` - This command pushed all committed code to the remote repository on GitHub.

### Steps to deply website to Github Pages

### Deploying the Website to GitHub Pages

- The website was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
- In the GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab.
- From the left-side menu, select 'Pages.'
- In the source section drop-down menu, choose the 'main' branch.
- Click 'Save.'
- Upon successful publishing, a live link will be displayed in a green banner.

### Steps for cloning the repository

1. Click on the "Code" button near the top right corner of the page.
2. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL that appears in the box.
3. Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Type "git clone" followed by a space, and then paste the URL you copied in step 3.
5. Press enter to run the command. This will clone the repository onto your local machine.
6. You should now have a local copy of the GitHub repository on your machine.

### Cloning the Repository

1. To clone the repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

- Click on the "Code" button located near the top right corner of the page.
- Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL displayed.
- Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and navigate to your desired directory.
- Enter "git clone" followed by a space, and paste the copied URL.
- Press enter to execute the command, creating a local copy of the GitHub repository.

2. You now have the GitHub repository cloned to your local machine.

### Forking the Repository

1. Fork the repository by following these steps:

2. Click the "Fork" button found near the top right corner of the page. This duplicates the repository into your GitHub account.
3. After forking, you will be redirected to your forked repository.
4. If not already done, clone the forked repository to your local machine, using the instructions mentioned earlier.
5. Make any desired changes or additions to the code in your local copy of the repository.
6. Commit your changes to your local repository using the "git commit" command.
7. Push your changes to the forked repository on GitHub with the "git push" command.
8. If you intend to contribute your changes back to the original repository, initiate a pull request. You can do this by going to the original repository's page and selecting the "New pull request" button. From there, you can compare your changes to the original repository and request a merge.
9. You now have a forked copy of the GitHub repository in your account, allowing you to make changes and contribute back to the original repository if desired.
